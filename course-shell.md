# Motivation

As computer scientists, we know that computers are great at aiding in
repetitive tasks. However, far too often, we forget that this applies
just as much to our _use_ of the computer as it does to the computations
we want our programs to perform. We have a vast range of tools
available at our fingertips that enable us to be more productive and
solve more complex problems when working on any computer-related
problem. Yet many of us utilize only a small fraction of those tools; we
only know enough magical incantations by rote to get by, and blindly
copy-paste commands from the internet when we get stuck.

This class is an attempt to address this.

We want to teach you how to make the most of the tools you know, show
you new tools to add to your toolbox, and hopefully instill in you some
excitement for exploring (and perhaps building) more tools on your own.
This is what we believe to be the missing semester from most Computer
Science curriculum.

# Class structure

The class consists of 11 1-hour lectures, each one centering on a
[particular topic](/lectures/). The lectures are largely independent,
though as the semester goes on we will presume that you are familiar
with the content from the earlier lectures. We have lecture notes
online, but there will be a lot of content covered in class (e.g. in the
form of demos) that may not be in the notes. We will be recording
lectures and posting the recordings online.

We are trying to cover a lot of ground over the course of just 11 1-hour
lectures, so the lectures are fairly dense. To allow you some time to
get familiar with the content at your own pace, each lecture includes a
set of exercises that guide you through the lecture's key points. After
each lecture, we are hosting office hours where we will be present to
help answer any questions you might have.

Due to the limited time we have, we won't be able to cover all the tools
in the same level of detail a full-scale class might. Where possible, we
will try to point you towards resources for digging further into a tool
or topic, but if something particularly strikes your fancy, don't
hesitate to reach out to us and ask for pointers!

# Topic 1: The Shell

## What is the shell?

Computers these days have a variety of interfaces for giving them
commands; fancyful graphical user interfaces, voice interfaces, and
even AR/VR are everywhere. These are great for 80% of use-cases, but
they are often fundamentally restricted in what they allow you to do —
you cannot press a button that isn't there or give a voice command that
hasn't been programmed. To take full advantage of the tools your
computer provides, we have to go old-school and drop down to a textual
interface: The Shell.

Nearly all platforms you can get your hand on has a shell in one form or
another, and many of them have several shells for you to choose from.
While they may vary in the details, at their core they are all roughly
the same: they allow you to run programs, give them input, and inspect
their output in a semi-structured way.

In this lecture, we will focus on the Bourne Again SHell, or "bash" for
short. This is one of the most widely used shells, and its syntax is
similar to what you will see in many other shells. To open a shell
_prompt_ (where you can type commands), you first need a _terminal_.
Your device probably shipped with one installed, or you can install one
fairly easily.

## Using the shell

When you launch your terminal, you will see a _prompt_ that often looks
a little like this:

```console
missing:~$ 
```

This is the main textual interface to the shell. It tells you that you
are on the machine `missing` and that your "current working directory",
or where you currently are, is `~` (short for "home"). The `$` tells you
that you are not the root user (more on that later). At this prompt you
can type a _command_, which will then be interpreted by the shell. The
most basic command is to execute a program:

```console
missing:~$ date
Fri 10 Jan 2020 11:49:31 AM EST
missing:~$ 
```

Here, we executed the `date` program, which (perhaps unsurprisingly)
prints the current date and time. The shell then asks us for another
command to execute. We can also execute a command with _arguments_:

```console
missing:~$ echo hello
hello
```

In this case, we told the shell to execute the program `echo` with the
argument `hello`. The `echo` program simply prints out its arguments.
The shell parses the command by splitting it by whitespace, and then
runs the program indicated by the first word, supplying each subsequent
word as an argument that the program can access. If you want to provide
an argument that contains spaces or other special characters (e.g., a
directory named "My Photos"), you can either quote the argument with `'`
or `"` (`"My Photos"`), or escape just the relevant characters with `\`
(`My\ Photos`).

But how does the shell know how to find the `date` or `echo` programs?
Well, the shell is a programming environment, just like Python or Ruby,
and so it has variables, conditionals, loops, and functions (next
lecture!). When you run commands in your shell, you are really writing a
small bit of code that your shell interprets. If the shell is asked to
execute a command that doesn't match one of its programming keywords, it
consults an _environment variable_ called `$PATH` that lists which
directories the shell should search for programs when it is given a
command:


```console
missing:~$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
missing:~$ which echo
/bin/echo
missing:~$ /bin/echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

When we run the `echo` command, the shell sees that it should execute
the program `echo`, and then searches through the `:`-separated list of
directories in `$PATH` for a file by that name. When it finds it, it
runs it (assuming the file is _executable_; more on that later). We can
find out which file is executed for a given program name using the
`which` command. We can also bypass `$PATH` entirely by giving the
_path_ to the file we want to execute.

## Navigating in the shell

A path on the shell is a delimited list of directories; separated by `/`
on Linux and macOS and `\` on Windows. On Linux and macOS, the path `/`
is the "root" of the file system, under which all directories and files
lie, whereas on Windows there is one root for each disk partition (e.g.,
`C:\`). We will generally assume that you are using a Linux filesystem
in this class. A path that starts with `/` is called an _absolute_ path.
Any other path is a _relative_ path. Relative paths are relative to the
current working directory, which we can see with the `pwd` command and
change with the `cd` command. In a path, `.` refers to the current
directory, and `..` to its parent directory:

```console
missing:~$ pwd
/home/missing
missing:~$ cd /home
missing:/home$ pwd
/home
missing:/home$ cd ..
missing:/$ pwd
/
missing:/$ cd ./home
missing:/home$ pwd
/home
missing:/home$ cd missing
missing:~$ pwd
/home/missing
missing:~$ ../../bin/echo hello
hello
```

Notice that our shell prompt kept us informed about what our current
working directory was. You can configure your prompt to show you all
sorts of useful information, which we will cover in a later lecture.

In general, when we run a program, it will operate in the current
directory unless we tell it otherwise. For example, it will usually
search for files there, and create new files there if it needs to.

To see what lives in a given directory, we use the `ls` command:

```console
missing:~$ ls
missing:~$ cd ..
missing:~$ ls
missing
missing:~$ cd ..
missing:~$ ls
bin
boot
dev
etc
home
...
```

Unless a directory is given as its first argument, `ls` will print the
contents of the current directory. Most commands accept flags and
options (flags with values) that start with `-` to modify their
behavior. Usually, running a program with the `-h` or `--help` flag
(`/?` on Windows) will print some help text that tells you what flags
and options are available. For example, `ls --help` tells us:

```
  -l                         use a long listing format
```

```console
missing:~$ ls -l /home
drwxr-xr-x 1 missing  users  4096 Jun 15  2019 missing
```

This gives us a bunch more information about each file or directory
present. First, the `d` at the beginning of the line tells us that
`missing` is a directory. Then follow three groups of three characters
(`rwx`). These indicate what permissions the owner of the file
(`missing`), the owning group (`users`), and everyone else respectively
have on the relevant item. A `-` indicates that the given principal does
not have the given permission. Above, only the owner is allowed to
modify (`w`) the `missing` directory (i.e., add/remove files in it). To
enter a directory, a user must have "search" (represented by "execute":
`x`) permissions on that directory (and its parents). To list its
contents, a user must have read (`r`) permissions on that directory. For
files, the permissions are as you would expect. Notice that nearly all
the files in `/bin` have the `x` permission set for the last group,
"everyone else", so that anyone can execute those programs.

Some other handy programs to know about at this point are `mv` (to
rename/move a file), `cp` (to copy a file), and `mkdir` (to make a new
directory).

If you ever want _more_ information about a program's arguments, inputs,
outputs, or how it works in general, give the `man` command a try. It
takes as an argument the name of a program, and shows you its _manual
page_. Press `q` to exit.

```console
missing:~$ man ls
```

## Connecting programs

In the shell, programs have two primary "streams" associated with them:
their input stream and their output stream. When the program tries to
read input, it reads from the input stream, and when it prints
something, it prints to its output stream. Normally, a program's input
and output are both your terminal. That is, your keyboard as input and
your screen as output. However, we can also rewire those streams!

The simplest form of redirection is `< file` and `> file`. These let you
rewire the input and output streams of a program to a file respectively:

```console
missing:~$ echo hello > hello.txt
missing:~$ cat hello.txt
hello
missing:~$ cat < hello.txt
hello
missing:~$ cat < hello.txt > hello2.txt
missing:~$ cat hello2.txt
hello
```

You can also use `>>` to append to a file. Where this kind of
input/output redirection really shines is in the use of _pipes_. The `|`
operator lets you "chain" programs such that the output of one is the
input of another:

```console
missing:~$ ls -l / | tail -n1
drwxr-xr-x 1 root  root  4096 Jun 20  2019 var
missing:~$ curl --head --silent google.com | grep --ignore-case content-length | cut --delimiter=' ' -f2
219
```

We will go into a lot more detail about how to take advantage of pipes
in the lecture on data wrangling.

# Next steps

At this point you know your way around a shell enough to accomplish
basic tasks. You should be able to navigate around to find files of
interest and use the basic functionality of most programs. In the next
lecture, we will talk about how to perform and automate more complex
tasks using the shell and the many handy command-line programs out
there.
